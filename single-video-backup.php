				<p>TMS uses principles of electromagnetism to target specific areas in the brain that are known to be involved in depression. Initially it was used as a way of helping researchers map the brain, but eventually people started to wonder, could it be used to help people with various psychiatric illnesses because it has so few side effects, especially compared with medications. 
				<br/><br/>When a person takes an antidepressant medication, that medication affects the entire body. 
				<br/><br/>Whereas with TMS, we're just affecting specific neurons in the brain. When these neurons are stimulated by TMS, they release neurotransmitters and these neurotransmitters help decrease the symptoms of depression. 
				<br/><br/>Repeatedly stimulating these neurons wakes up the brain and allows these neurons to start functioning on their own. TMS doesn't affect other tissues like the skull or the scalp, which makes it a much more comfortable treatment and doesn't require anesthesia. 
				<br/><br/>It's a really exciting advancement in the treatment of depression, for so many people who haven't gotten benefit from medications or therapy, or for whom the side effects of medication has proved intolerable.</p>
