					<p class="roboto-regular mb-20">TMS is an FDA approved, noninvasive and nonmedication treatment option that uses electromagnetism to effectively treat depression in patients who have failed prior antidepressant treatments.</p>
					<p class="roboto-regular mb-20">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been studied for over 30 years, initially as a way of mapping specific areas of the brain to assist researchers in their studies. Soon researchers began to wonder if stimulating the brain in specific areas could be used to treat a variety of different illnesses. After multiple studies, TMS received FDA approval in 2008 to treat Major Depressive Disorder in patients who had failed one antidepressant trial. Since then, advances in the treatment and technique of TMS have contributed to the growing body of evidence that TMS is a powerful tool for treating depression.</p>
					<p class="roboto-regular mb-0">TMS treats depression by transmitting electromagnetic pulses to a particular part of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Nerves in this part of the brain are stimulated by these pulses and, with repeated treatments over the course of a few weeks, this stimulation results in a significant decrease in depressive symptoms for many patients. Not only is TMS treatment effective, the side effects are minimal and the results are durable for most patients. TMS can be used as a stand-alone treatment for depression or it can be used in concert with medications and therapy.</p>

					<p class="roboto-regular mb-20">Co-founder, <b>Dr. Jonathan Horey,</b> became familiar with TMS while training and working at Columbia University in New York City where many of the early and important studies on TMS were conducted. Dr. Horey has since completed more extensive training in TMS and keeps himself up-to-date with the latest research on brain stimulation techniques, including TMS.</p>
					<p class="roboto-regular mb-20">In 2016, after moving from New York City to Portland, Dr. Horey was treating a patient in his private practice who had tried multiple different treatments for depression without improvement. He began to look for a TMS clinic to refer to in the Portland area but found that there were no TMS clinics available for his patient. Thus began the journey to open Active Recovery TMS to provide this ground-breaking treatment to patients in his community. </p>
					<p class="roboto-regular mb-20">With the help of his co-founder Michael, who manages the business arm of the clinic, Active Recovery TMS was born. Active Recovery TMS started treating patients in January of 2017.</p>
