                    <p class="roboto-regular mb-20">With approximately 2.4 million people within the metropolitan statistical area, this port city is vibrant, eclectic, and committed to environmental solvency, making it one of the most liveable cities in the United States.</p>
                    <p class="roboto-regular mb-20">Portland offers numerous transportation options, making it easy to access the TMS therapy facility. Whether traveling by car, bus, bicycle, TriMet (rail), or on foot, after visiting the TMS Portland clinic, patients have the option of stopping at one of the many coffee shops and eateries located nearby. In addition, the city is known for its farm-to-table restaurants, so many healthy dining choices are available nearby.</p>
                    <p class="roboto-regular mb-0">TMS therapy does not require sedation or anesthesia, so patients will not be groggy or sleepy after treatment. That means patients will also be able to take advantage of the cityâ€™s many opportunities for respite and/or entertainment. Portland has over 10,0000 acres of public parks, is located on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, and sits at the foot of Mount Hood. It also offers numerous microbreweries, the Oregon Zoo, and formal Japanese Gardens. The city is an exciting art, theatre, and art venue. That means trips to TMS Portland can easily be combined with a night out on the town!</p>

                            <h3 class="roboto-bold mt-0 mb-20">What is Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)?</h3>
                            <p class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-0">Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and pain-free procedure that uses a continuous electrical current to create a magnetic field around a specific area of the brain. It is believed that the magnetic field stimulates the reward and motivation pathways of the brain in the subgenual anterior cirgulate cortex, thereby reducing or eliminating depressive episodes.</p>

                            <h3 class="roboto-bold mt-50 mb-30">How Does Deep TMS Work?</h3>
                            <p class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-20">Treatment for depression typically involves medication and/or psychotherapy. When those strategies are ineffective, deep transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy is an appropriate alternative.</p>
                            <p class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-20">TMS was developed in 1985 as a way to target and treat the parts of the brain believed to affect  depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. Various forms of TMS are now used, including deep and repetitive TMS. While both use coils that contain electromagnets, they treat the affected area of the brain differently. Deep TMS creates a magnetic field that stimulates the reward and motivation pathways of the brain in the subgenual anterior cirgulate cortex. Repetitive TMS uses magnetic pulses to target the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. While deep TMS reaches about four centimeters (approximately one-and-a-half inches) into the brain, repetitive TMS only penetrates about one and a half centimeters. Studies suggest that deep TMS may have a longer lasting cognitive impact than repetitive TMS. </p>
                            <p class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-0">The efficacy of TMS as a treatment for depression is supported by a 2010 National Institute of Mental Health study, which found that 14 percent of study participants achieved remission. After the initial clinical trial ended, all participants were permitted to enter a second phase. Participants were again treated with TMS and rates of remission climbed to almost 30 percent.</p>

                    <h3 class="roboto-bold mb-20 mt-0">What Does TMS Treatment Involve?</h3>
                    <p class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-0">Deep TMS therapy uses a helmet or hat-like device that contains a coil with electromagnets. When an electrical current runs through the coil, it creates a magnetic field in front of the head. A session generally lasts about 20 minutes. However, the initial calibration session may take up to 40 minutes.</p>

                            <p class="roboto-regular mt-0">Deep TMS is considered a safe and well-tolerated procedure. The magnetic field is equivalent to an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging scan). Patients are provided with ear protection to minimize the noise created by the magnet. Recent studies found that TMS treatment results in almost no side effects, but those that were reported were mild or moderate. Side effects may include:</p>
                            <ul class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-30">
                                <li>Discomfort from the electromagnet placed on the forehead.</li>
                                <li>Contracting or tingling of the scalp, jaw, or face muscles.</li>
                                <li>Mild headaches or brief lightheadedness.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-0 pb-70">In most cases, the level of stimulation can be adjusted to reduce side effects or over-the-counter medications can be taken prior to the procedure.</p>

                            <p class="roboto-regular mt-0 mb-0 pb-70">Anything containing metal should be removed from the body. In addition, it is important to disclose any metal or medical devices implanted within the body, such as pacemakers or stimulators. You will also be asked about medical conditions that can be impacted by TMS, including pregnancy or epilepsy. </p>
